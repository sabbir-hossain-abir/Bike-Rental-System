# INTRODUCTION

BikeBook is an online bike rental system. A company named bikebook offers multiple categories of bikes for rent for people around the country. So we have designed an application from where the customer can register to rent their desirable bike or bicycle for a specific time.       
This is a simple web-based open source software written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript(React) and Nodejs.

## 1.1 Purpose<br>
From the BikeBook people would be able to rent the bike from a specific renting point. And they can rent the bike for that specific time period and after their use, they can submit the bike on some specific points. This will solve many problems. Now people do need to avoid owning a bike to ride. They can rent a bike and ride as much as they want. This will also benefit traffic management. As a two-wheeled vehicle is less prone to create traffic jams.

## 1.3 Technology
<b>Programming Language</b><br>
For this project we will be using React js which is a framework of JavaScript for the frontend development of the application. As we know that React is the best option out there right now for frontend development because it provides a  huge opportunity of working with the interactivity of the website. 
We will be using Node.js + Express.js as the backend programming language. Which provides great support in working with a full JavaScript environment.

<b>Database</b><br>
We will be using MongoDB as our Database management system. MongoDB is one of the most popular Database management systems out there right now. What makes it more versatile than another typical RDBMS is it's more reliable considering the advancement of technology. MongoDB is a database that is more advanced and capable of handling big data with dynamic schema features.

<b>Others</b><br>
We will be using basic HTML, CSS and its framework Bootstrap 5, which provides various options for playing the style. We will use Redux as our state management tool.
